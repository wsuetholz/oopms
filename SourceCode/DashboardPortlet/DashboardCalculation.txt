A. Cost:
red: end date to check, > budget 
Yellow: end date to check, from 80 - 100% budget
Green: end date to check, < 80% budget.

Example:

Budget: 100000
Use end date of project to calculate the final cost with existing cost entry:
--> Result:	X > 100000 --> RED
		80000 =< X =< 100000 --> YELLOW
		X < 80000 --> GREEN

B. PercentProgress:
4 type of Product (currently fixed, considering input by PM): LOC, TestCase, Page, Sheet
Coefficient: LOC 1, TestCase 3, Page 30, Sheet 30 (means: 1 dev 1 day: 300 LOC, 100 TestCase, 10 Page, 10 Sheet).

Convert all products into one unit to calculate the percent of completeness.

Example:

1 Product LOC: 400/1000
1 Product TestCase: 500/1000
1 Product Page: 800/1000
1 Product Sheet: 500/1000
1 Product TestCase: 300/1000

	Convert:	
		1 Product LOC: 400/1000
		1 Product TestCase: 1500/3000
		1 Product Page: 24000/30000
		1 Product Sheet: 15000/30000
		1 Product TestCase: 900/3000
	--> 41.8/67 = 62%


C. PercentTime: Always Green.

D. EfficiencyStatus:

1. Total actual size of all tasks: current amount of work done (Convert all into one unit).
2. Total amount of days from the start date of tasks to current date: total days the team had spent to do the tasks.
3. Norm number (fixed or enter by PM): amount of work 1 member can do a day (Convert all into one unit).
4. Number of Team members: 

From 1,2: Amount of work team complete in one day. 5
From 3,4: Amount of work team supposed to complete in one day. 6

5 = 6 (variation 10%): YELLOW.
5 > 6 + 6*10%: GREEN.
5 < 6 - 6*10%: RED.


E. Health: --> 

just one red --> red
all green --> green
rest --> yellow
