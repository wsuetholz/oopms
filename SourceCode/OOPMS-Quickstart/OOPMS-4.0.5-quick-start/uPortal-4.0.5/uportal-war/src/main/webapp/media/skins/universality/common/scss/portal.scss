 * These declarations are scoped for the portal, and not specifically for portlets.
 * For portlet-specifc CSS, see "portlet.css" in the same directory.
 * CSS specified at the portal scope will naturally cascade into portlets.
 * This CSS assumes the use of a CSS reset (by default the FSS "fss-reset.css") for browser normalization.
